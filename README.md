## Modern cybersecurity analytics depends on clean, reliable data.
In this project, you will clean a messy firewall log dataset and prepare it for security analysis.

You will complete:

- Part A (5%) — DataCamp Chapter 1 (Common Data Problems)
- Part B (10%) — Clean the provided raw_firewall_logs.csv using Python
